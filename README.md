# Necromancers-Selfbot
Advanced Necromancers Selfbot built by Theo

Personal-purpose selfbot built by Theo, now public and usable even by non-necromancers members! Also fuck yourself for being a skid

Tutorial on how to start it:
Download Visual Studio Code and Python 1.7.3 (watch a youtube video for details)
Create a file named main.py and paste the representative piece of code in it
Download seized.png and open it on the workspace later on to make sure the changing icon part works 

Enjoy
